		<b>Volcanology</b> (also spelled vulcanology) is the study of volcanoes, lava, magma, and related geological,
		geophysical and geochemical phenomena. The term volcanology is derived from the Latin word vulcan.
		Vulcan was the ancient Roman god of fire.
		A <b>volcanologist</b> is a geologist who studies the eruptive activity and formation of volcanoes, and
		their current and historic eruptions. Volcanologists frequently visit volcanoes, especially active ones,
		to observe volcanic eruptions, collect eruptive products including tephra (such as ash or pumice), rock and lava samples.
		One major focus of enquiry is the prediction of eruptions; there is currently no accurate way to do this,
		but predicting eruptions, like predicting earthquakes, could save many lives.
