My option that I chose to store the user info is through:
Session using a Tomcat Server

1. I used the Java EE for the creation of a Dynamic Web Project
2. I used the Eclipse Kepler as my IDE
3. I used Struts2 as the web framework
4. I have also used a Java Bean to store the whole object on the session scope

PS. I would like to store it on the session storage of the browser. If I have still time,
I would like to do it.
