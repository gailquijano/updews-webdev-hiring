Good day!

I am Kevin Dhale S. Dela Cruz and this is my submission for the 
SRS II Web Developer's Examination.

The following exercises were created and tested under XAMPP local server.

+         In order to test things out smoothly, kindly copy my exercise folder on htdocs folders
under XAMPP. Use "http://localhost/KevinDhaleDelaCruz/Day<X>/<doc.html>". 
This is to ensure that links and hrefs will reference their supposed destinations.

 +        Also note that I used index.html on some exercises instead of home.html.

Thank you very much!
